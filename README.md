This project aims to build a structured and efficient library book data collection system by utilizing the General Tree data structure. The system is designed to store, manage, and browse book data based on a flexible and extensible category hierarchy.
In the General Tree structure, each node can have more than two children, which is very suitable for grouping books based on main categories, subcategories, to a more specific level. For example, the root node can represent “Library”, its children represent categories such as ‘technology’, “literature” and so on. Each category can have subcategories such as “technology > informatics”, “literature > fiction”, and underneath are related book data.

Key Features:
The system supports searching books by title or by category.
A simple borrowing and returning system
book descriptions such as year, author, and rating.

Benefits of General Tree Structure:
Supports complex and flexible hierarchical structures.
Easy grouping and searching of books based on logical classification.
High scalability for adding new categories and subcategories.

Implementation:
Programming language: Python
Data structure: General Tree with nodes that store category information and book lists.
Interface: HTML, CSS
